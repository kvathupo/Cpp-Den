# What?
A collection of algorithms and data structures in C++. 

The code is designed to be dropped in to any codebase that is compliant with the most recent
standard. As such, template parameters only require those operations that are absolutely necessary
for the implementation of an algorithm or data structure. Thus, type-safety and performance are prioritized.

# Why?
Personally, to keep up with the Standard. Professionally, to avoid having to repeatedly
code non-Standard functionality, e.g. Pairing Heaps, hardware-independent packet parsers.

# When?
Code is to be updated infrequently for whenever I want to brush up on the most recent Standard,
or repeatedly code something.

So feel free to fork!
